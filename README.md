# Ollie Pinto Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, designed to showcase selected work, experiments, and how I approach modern marketing and creative strategy.

Live site: [https://www.olliepinto.com](https://www.olliepinto.com)

## About The Project

The site is a single-page experience focused on clarity, movement, and storytelling. It combines a clean content structure with expressive visual design to present:

- A short personal introduction
- Brand and platform experience
- Case-study style work highlights
- An experimental "lab" section
- A direct contact flow

## How It’s Built

This project is built as a static-first Astro site with React islands for interactive sections. That approach keeps core content fast and SEO-friendly while allowing richer UI behavior where it matters.

Most written content is structured in a central JSON data model, which makes updates consistent across sections and keeps layout logic separate from copy.

## Architecture Highlights

- Astro for page composition, layout, and metadata management
- React islands for interactive components like navigation, modals, and animated content rails
- Tailwind CSS + design tokens for a consistent, themeable visual system
- Framer Motion for purposeful transitions and UI movement
- Structured SEO setup including canonical tags, social preview metadata, and schema markup

## Design Direction

The design balances editorial style with interactive UI:

- Bold typography and layered backgrounds
- Motion-led section transitions
- Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile
- Light/dark theming with accessibility in mind

## Purpose

This portfolio is intended to communicate both strategic thinking and execution quality: not just what I have worked on, but how I think and build.
